### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on... nothing??
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - C++ (and JNI)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for... nothing??
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about developing plugin i guess (with stacktraces if you have one)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: osu__player#1443 (preferred), me@acrylicstyle.xyz
  - Please see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/ja/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#5-information-usage-restrictions) for usage restriction by github. (tl;dr: don't send me any promotion emails through github)
- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - i don't play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13293262), probably. (I do still care about ezpp, though)
  - thanks github for creating fork every time i try to edit repo that i don't have write permission
